#1. Writing into csv with unnecessary index
#2. Using column names which include spaces
#3. Filter dataset like a PRO with QUERY method
#4.  query strings with(@ symbol) to easily reach variables
#5. "inplace" method could be removed in future versions, better explicitly overwrite modifications
#6. better Vectorization instead of iteration
#7. Vectorization method are preferable than Apply method
#8. df.copy() method
#9. chaining formulas is better than creating many intermediate dataframes
#10. properly set column dtypes
#11. using Boolean instead of Strings
#12.  pandas plot method instead of matplotlib import
#13. pandas str.upper() instead apply and etc
#14. use data pipeline once instead of repeating many times
#15. learn proper way of renaming columns
#16. learn proper way of grouping values
#17. proper way of complex grouping values
#18. percent_change or difference now could be implemend with function
#19. save time and space with large datasets with pickle,parquet,feather formats
#20. conditional format in pandas(like in Microsoft Excel)
#21. use suffixes while merging TWO dataframes
#22. check merging is success with validation 
#23. wrapping expression so they are readable 
#24. categorical datatypes use less space
#25. duplicating columns after concatenating, code snippet
